# J.W.S.T. 2048
## a 2048 puzzle game on a hex field of a James Webb Space Telescope

Idea, design, and programming by Andrei Shevelev
(some assets, notably the video back are not my property and are included for illustration purposes)

---
## To build:
1) Copy the project locally
2) run "npm i"
3) run "npm run start_orig"
   (for MacOS you need to **substitute all entries** of "\\" with "/" in assets building script `nodeScripts/GenerateAssets.js`)

---
## To play:
open `localhost:8080` or the local IP address as reported in the terminal by a web server (when you run "npm run start_orig")

The game is playable with a keyboard: **Q,W,E,A,S,D** to move the board and Arrows: **UP** to change a video background, **LEFT** and **RIGHT** to dim or brighten it.
Can also be played on mobile/touch devices - just **swipe** in the corresponding direction.
